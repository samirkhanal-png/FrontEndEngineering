new Promise() is added to the call stack and promise object is created

.then resolve or reject callback function is added to call stack queue normally or any code inside is added to some queue according to the situation

When the promise is resolved or rejected then it goes to call stack 

Promise state is fulfilled and we get a promise result done.

Then, then goes to the callstack queue.

.then is responsible for creating (promise reaction record) 
promiseFulfill reaction handler which is sent to the microtask queue. 

this reaction handler takes the previous promise result as the argument of the reaction handler function.
